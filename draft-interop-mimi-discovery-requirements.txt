                      User Discovery Requirements
            draft-interop-mimi-discovery-requirements-latest

Abstract

   This document defines requirements for the user discovery problem
   within the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working
   group.  User discovery is essential for interoperability, allowing
   message senders to locate recipients across diverse platforms using
   globally unique, cross-service identifiers (e.g., email addresses,
   phone numbers).  The core challenge involves reliably mapping these
   identifiers to messaging service providers and determining the
   reachability of a recipient's identifier across multiple providers.

1.  Introduction

   MIMI user discovery enables a message sender to locate messaging
   service providers on which a particular recipient can be reached.
   Currently, users often need to ask contacts what service they are on
   out-of-band or try multiple services, which creates friction.
   Specifically, discovery helps a user on one messaging service (Alice
   on Service A) to find another user on a potentially different or the
   same service (Bob on Service B) without prior knowledge of Bob's
   provider, and in a provider-neutral manner.

   Discovery is necessary because the identifiers we commonly have for
   contacts (phone numbers, email addresses, etc.) do not necessarily
   tell us which messaging service they are using.  Someone with the
   email alice@gmail.com might use iMessage, Signal, or another service
   entirely.  Thus, the core problem is how to take one of these cross-
   service identifiers and learn the messaging service provider that the
   user is using and how to communicate with them on that service.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   1.  _Cross-Service Identifier (CSI)_: A globally unique identifier
       for a user across multiple services (e.g., E.164 phone number,
       email address).

   2.  _Cross-Service Identifier Provider (CSIP)_: An entity that issues
       and manages CSIs (e.g., telecom providers, email providers).

   3.  _Messaging Service Provider (MSP)_: An entity offering messaging
       services to end users (e.g., WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage).

   4.  _Service Specific Identifier (SSI)_: A unique identifier for a
       user within a single MSP (e.g., a Twitter handle).

   5.  _Discovery Provider (DP)_: An entity that stores and facilitates
       the discovery of MSPs for a given CSI.  A DP may be operated by
       an MSP or a third party.

   6.  _Verifiable Mapping_: A representation of the cryptographic
       binding of a CSI and the set of MSPs where the CSI is reachable.

   7.  _Recipient_: A user who possesses a CSI that has been assigned by
       a CSIP and authorizes verifiable mapping of that CSI to an MSP
       set.

   8.  _Sender_: A user who queries a DP to discover the MSPs for a
       given CSI.

3.  User Discovery Problem Statement

   User discovery involves two key aspects:

   1.  _Authorization_: Recipients must be able to authorize verifiable
       mappings between their CSIs and their chosen MSPs.

   2.  _Lookup_: Senders must be able to query these mappings to
       determine where a recipient can be reached.

   To authorize verifiable mappings, the recipient must:

   *  Possess a valid, CSIP-issued CSI.

   *  Have active accounts with each MSP to be mapped.

   *  Associate the CSI with each of those accounts.

   Discovered mappings must be verifiable to ensure they are accurate.
   Crucially, discovery must prioritize user privacy, allowing users to
   control their discoverability, and it must integrate well with end-
   to-end encryption and other MIMI protocols.

   *Note:* This document focuses on discovering _which_ MSPs a user is
   on.  Retrieving SSIs and cryptographic keys can be a separate,
   subsequent step.

   The rest of this document describes a series of requirements for the
   discovery problem.

4.  Prior Efforts

   Discovery services are far from new on the Internet.  The whois
   protocol [RFC3912], largely focused on mapping domain names to
   associated services, was one of the earliest discovery services
   deployed on the Internet.  DNS SRV records, specified in [RFC2782],
   allow a similar process - given a domain name, a user can discover
   available services, such as VoIP based on the Session Initiation
   Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] [RFC3263].  SRV records were adapted
   specifically for messaging in [RFC3861].  However, both whois and DNS
   SRV records rely on domain names as lookup keys, making them
   unsuitable for identifiers like mobile phone numbers, which don't
   have inherent domain associations.

   ENUM [RFC6117] addressed this limitation.  It used DNS to look up
   phone numbers by reversing the digits and adding the "e164.arpa"
   suffix.  This allowed delegation of portions of the namespace to
   telecom providers who owned specific number prefixes.  While
   technically straightforward, public deployment of ENUM was hampered
   by challenges in establishing authority for prefixes.  However,
   private ENUM [RFC6116] services have become relatively common,
   facilitating functions like MMS routing within messaging.

   Another attempt was ViPR (Verification Involving PSTN Reachability)
   [I-D.rosenberg-dispatch-vipr-overview] [I-D.petithuguenin-vipr-pvp].
   ViPR utilized a peer-to-peer network based on RELOAD (Resource
   Location and Discovery) [RFC6940] to operate between enterprises.  It
   addressed the authority problem by authorizing records based on proof
   of forward routability but faced the same network effects issue as
   ENUM.  ViPR attempted to address incentive problems by focusing on
   enterprises seeking cost savings by bypassing the phone network.
   Ultimately, network effects challenges (among other protocol-
   unrelated issues) prevented widespread deployment.

   Discovery and lookup services are now commonplace on the Internet but
   are largely scoped within large providers such as Facebook, Twitter,
   WhatsApp, and others.

   The MIMI discovery service requires a solution that works across
   providers.

                                  Table 1

6.  Recipient Authorization of Mappings

   _R1: Only the recipient MUST be able to authorize verifiable mapping
   of the recipient's CSI to an MSP set._

   This requirement prevents unauthorized mapping and potential
   impersonation attacks.  The integrity of mappings requires the
   recipient to be the sole party to authorize mappings of the
   recipient's CSI to the designated MSP set.  Allowing any other user
   besides the recipient to authorize the creation of verifiable
   mappings could open the recipient to impersonation attacks, where the
   MSP set will include MSPs where the attacker controls the accounts.

   It is expected that the recipient has active accounts with each MSP
   in the set and has already linked the CSI with each of those MSP
   accounts.  If a recipient includes MSPs that do not meet these
   preconditions, the recipient will not be reachable on the incorrect
   MSPs.  While this problem can be resolved if each MSP participates in
   creating verifiable mappings to confirm the recipient's account
   exists, mapping creation will be more involved.  Hence, this issue is
   deferred as a post-discovery problem to address.

7.  Recipient Preferences in Mappings

   _R2: A mapping MUST allow for the inclusion of tags or similar
   constructs to indicate the recipient's preferences for using each
   included MSP._

   This requirement allows recipients to guide how senders contact them
   on different MSPs.  For example, a preference tag may be formulated
   as closed or open-ended strings (e.g., "Business", "Personal",
   "BasketballFriends", "WhatsApp") or a list (e.g., "Business,
   WhatsApp").  A recipient might want senders to utilize a specific
   "Business" mapping for business messaging and a different one for
   other types of messaging.

   This requirement prioritizes recipient preferences because senders
   already have flexibility in choosing their MSP (and potentially DP)
   when initiating requests.  Further considerations regarding sender
   and DP preferences, as well as more complex recipient preferences,
   are deemed to be implementation issues.  See Appendix B: Recipient's
   Critical User Journeys for some more examples for recipients.

8.  Sender Retrieval of Mappings

   _R3: Senders MUST be able to retrieve all verifiable mappings for a
   CSI._

   This requirement ensures senders have complete information for
   reaching a recipient.  When a sender queries for mappings established
   for a given recipient's CSI, all available verifiable mappings that
   exist must be returned as a response.

9.  Mapping Authenticity Verification

   _R4: Senders MUST be able to verify the authenticity of mappings._

   This requirement enables senders to trust the mapping information.
   On receipt of the mappings that exist for a recipient's CSI, the
   sender should have a means to verify the authenticity of the mappings
   by learning that the recipient authorized that mapping.  The
   verification process may leverage all or parts of the mapping content
   and may involve network calls to an oracle to help with the
   verification, provided the oracle query process is consistent with
   Requirement 6.

10.  Support for Varying Mapping Results

   _R5: Discovery MUST support results with zero, one, or multiple
   mappings._

   This requirement covers cases where a user has no mappings, has opted
   out of discovery, or uses multiple MSPs.  Regardless of how the
   verifiable mapping structure is represented (e.g., one CSI to a set
   of MSPs, or one CSI to one MSP repeated for each MSP), senders must
   be able to determine the following from a user discovery response for
   a given CSI:

   *  No mapping exists, e.g., the recipient has not created any
      mapping.

   *  One or more mappings exist, but without listed MSPs, e.g., the
      recipient has intentionally configured discovery to return no
      mappings.

   *  One mapping exists with one listed MSP.

   *  One mapping exists with multiple listed MSPs.

   *  Multiple mappings exist, each potentially with a different number
      of MSPs.

   In situations where the recipient who authorized mappings using a
   CSI, such as an email address, becomes unreachable (e.g., due to the
   user's death), implementations can rely on the MSPs included in the
   mapping to resolve non-reachability issues outside user discovery.

11.  Protecting Sender and Recipient Privacy

   _R6: DPs MUST NOT be able to learn both the sender's identity and the
   recipient's CSI._

   This requirement prevents the DP from building a complete social
   graph of users across MSPs.  This protects user privacy by limiting
   the information the DP can gather about relationships between senders
   and recipients.

   User discovery lookups inherently create a connection point (an edge)
   on the social graph between the sender and the recipient.  To protect
   the privacy of both parties, the DP must be prevented from learning
   this connection consisting of the sender's identity and the
   recipient's CSI/mapping.  Specifically, the DP can learn at most one
   of the following:

   1.  Identifying information about the sender, such as their source IP
       address, username, etc.

   2.  The recipient's CSI and any associated response mappings.

   While the DP might be able to infer this edge or connection later if
   both users communicate through the same MSP, this requirement focuses
   on preventing the DP from directly learning this during discovery.
   To understand the importance of this, it's helpful to distinguish
   between two types of social graphs:

   *  Messaging social graph: Reflects actual communication between
      users.

   *  Discovery social graph: Encompasses all attempted user discovery
      lookups, which can be significantly larger than the messaging
      social graph, as it includes searches for users the sender may not
      ultimately contact.

   Protecting user privacy during discovery is crucial because, without
   it, a sender's entire discovery social graph could be revealed during
   bulk discovery that requires the lookup of all contacts on the
   sender's address book, which exposes a much broader range of
   potential connections than their actual messaging activity.
   Appendix C Protecting Sender-Recipient Social Graph Edge has some
   recommendations for implementation.

12.  In-Transit Encryption

   _R7: All data exchanged in the processing of a discovery request MUST
   be encrypted in transit._

   This requirement ensures the confidentiality of discovery requests
   and responses.

13.  Protection Against Enumeration Attacks

   _R8: DPs SHOULD be protected against enumeration attacks._

   This requirement ensures there is a security defense against attacks
   aimed at scraping mapping data.  Discovery providers should implement
   mechanisms to defend against large-scale scraping of mappings from
   their database, which can be used to compile spam targeting lists.

   One potential implementation approach is to utilize time-bound blind
   signatures.  This method limits the number of user discovery lookups
   a sender can perform within a given timeframe.  Each lookup request
   must include a unique, unblinded signature that cannot be linked to
   the sender's identity.  To facilitate rate-limiting across different
   server entities (e.g., DPs and MSPs), this unique signature should be
   passed along during communication.

14.  Mapping Removal

   _R9: DPs MUST provide a way to remove mappings._

   _R10: Only the recipient or the CSIP SHOULD be able to remove
   mappings_

   These requirements allow recipients to manage their discoverability
   and remove outdated mappings.  Authorization to remove verifiable
   mappings for a given CSI should be limited to only the recipient who
   authorized the mapping or the CSIP managing that CSI (for cases where
   a CSI is no longer assigned to any recipient).

   Recipients can change their minds and decide to make a prior mapping
   not discoverable; they may want to update mappings or start all over.
   Thus, a DP should provide a means to remove verifiable mappings.
   Once removed, a mapping should no longer be returned for senders'
   requests.

   A recipient that authorized the creation of a verifiable mapping
   should also be able to authorize its removal from the backend of DPs.
   Similarly, a CSIP may request the removal of mappings for a CSI that
   has become unassigned.

   A possible implementation approach is for verifiable mapping
   authorization to include a bit that the recipient can use to indicate
   if a mapping is new.  When that bit is set, a DP may proactively de-
   list any existing mapping for that CSI (after asking the user to re-
   confirm).  Note that the CSIP does not need to be aware of or be
   involved with the de-listing of mappings with such an approach.
   There are other approaches to ensure mappings are fresh and are not
   impacted when the same CSI is transferred between two recipients.

15.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are addressed throughout the document,
   particularly in requirements R1, R4, R6, R7, and R8.  These
   requirements focus on preventing unauthorized mapping, ensuring the
   authenticity of mappings, protecting user privacy, and securing data
   in transit and at rest.

16.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

Appendix A.  Architectural Models

   This appendix explores various architectural models for MIMI DP to
   provide an overview and address practical implementation
   considerations.  The working group observed these requirements are
   similar among these models and opted to maintain architectural
   neutrality for the discovery protocol.  However, we will outline
   requirements for the roles of DPs, how they interact with each other,
   MSPs in a federated model, and how DPs accommodate queries from both
   MSPs and users.

A.1.  Centralized DP (Monolithic Service)

   A globally accessible, authoritative database (potentially sharded/
   replicated) stores all authenticated CSI mappings.  This monolithic
   service, implemented across synchronized global nodes, handles all
   CSI queries from messaging platforms and acts as the single source of
   truth for mapping data, even if certain mappings may be restricted in
   specific regions due to geopolitical considerations.

A.1.1.  Advantages

   *  Standardization and uniform control over mapping creation,
      updates, and data formats.

   *  Promotes fair and unbiased CSI mapping discovery.

   *  Single source of truth for mapping simplifies data management and
      ensures consistency.

   *  Sharding/replication can address geographical distribution and
      performance needs.

A.1.2.  Drawbacks

   *  Centralization of sensitive user data raises privacy risks.

   *  May conflict with data localization regulations.

   *  Single point of failure vulnerability from outages affecting the
      entire system.

   *  Potential difficulty with immediate global updates for rapidly
      changing mappings.

A.2.  Hierarchical DPs (Discovery Resolvers)

   A global root Discovery Provider (DP) directs mapping requests to
   authoritative DPs based on CSI structure (e.g., country codes for
   E.164 phone numbers) or sharding mechanisms.  The root DP, similar to
   hierarchical DNS, acts as a directory service, holding pointers to
   authoritative DPs rather than mappings themselves.  Alternatives to
   hierarchical resolution, like the LoST protocol [RFC5222], or
   distributed hash tables (DHTs), can achieve similar outcomes.

A.2.1.  Advantages

   *  Scalability from distributed load and mapping management across
      multiple DPs.

   *  Flexibility that allows different DPs to specialize in specific
      CSI ranges for regions.

   *  Better alignment with data localization requirements.

A.2.2.  Drawbacks

   *  Requires coordination and maintenance of hierarchy.

   *  Root DP failure could disrupt the entire system.

   *  Potential delays due to additional hops in the discovery process.

A.3.  Federated DPs (Distributed Peer Service)

   In a federated model, multiple independent DPs collaborate to provide
   CSI mapping discovery.  Each DP holds a subset of mappings and
   pointers to other DPs, with no central authority dictating mapping
   locations.  Discovering all mappings for a CSI may involve querying
   multiple DPs.  DPs can exchange CSI information or recursively query
   each other.  The specifics of DP federation are determined by
   business agreements, not technical requirements.  A variation of this
   model involves messaging platforms acting as their own DPs, managing
   mappings for their users.

A.3.1.  Advantages

   *  Decentralization ensures there is no single point of control or
      failure.  The system can continue functioning even if some DPs are
      unavailable.

   *  Mappings can be distributed according to local regulations.

A.3.2.  Drawbacks

   *  Discovery process may involve querying multiple DPs, increasing
      network load.

   *  Potential for bias as DPs may prioritize their own mappings,
      leading to uneven results.

   *  Requires robust mechanisms to prevent CSI impersonation and ensure
      trust between DPs.

   *  Pairwise relationships in a federated DP model could create a
      barrier to entry for smaller MSP/DPs, similar to the trust
      requirements in the DKIM [RFC6376] and DMARC [RFC8616] ecosystems.

A.4.  Additional Considerations on Architectural Models

A.4.1.  Telephone Number CSIs

   Telephone number portability is complex due to its reliance on real-
   time queries to proprietary and legacy systems.  Overall, the
   authenticated mappings proposed for MIMI may necessitate additional
   platform measures to assess mapping freshness and ensure up-to-date
   reachability responses.

A.4.2.  Bias Mitigation

   Bias occurs when a DP prioritizes mappings to its affiliated MSP
   without consideration of what is best for end users.  Mitigating bias
   is essential to ensure fair and equitable discovery of authenticated
   mappings across different services.  The working group has decided to
   defer such mitigation to policies and regulations, excluding it from
   the discovery protocol.

Appendix B.  Recipient's Critical User Journeys

   Here are some Critical User Journeys (CUJs) that are the most
   important to discovery recipients.

   In the CUJs below, Bob is the recipient that creates verifiable
   mappings, and Alice is the sender or user performing discovery:

   1.  Sender mapping preferences: Bob only wants to be found by Alice
       and other users on WhatsApp, not his other messaging apps.

   2.  Same-app preferences: Bob prefers that Alice can find him on the
       same messaging service that she is using.  In other words, Bob
       does not want cross-app discovery and messaging.

   3.  No-random mapping preferences: Bob does not want to go through
       multiple apps to find a message from Alice when discovery returns
       one of 10 mappings that Bob has established with discovery
       providers.

   4.  No-duplication preferences: Bob does not want Alice's messages to
       be broadcasted to all or a subset of his apps based on the result
       of discovery.

   5.  Per-sender preferences: Bob wants to control which app messages
       from Alice go to and do the same for other users (e.g., Carol's
       messages may go to a different app than Alice's).

   6.  Closed group preferences: Bob only wants his soccer parents to
       discover and contact him on WhatsApp, not his Wire app.  That is,
       a group of senders has the same mapping results based on Bob's
       preferences.

   7.  Open-ended group preferences: Bob wants his business contacts to
       discover and reach him on Wire, not WhatsApp.  That is, an open-
       ended list of senders (i.e., including leads) are provided with a
       designated mapping.

Appendix C.  Protecting Sender-Recipient Social Graph Edge

   To protect user privacy, implementations should consider:

   1.  Sender Identity Protection: This approach focuses on concealing
       the sender's identity from the Discovery Provider (DP).
       Techniques like IP blinding (e.g., using a Private Relay) can be
       employed to achieve this, ensuring the DP only learns the
       recipient's CSI.

   2.  Recipient Identity Protection: This approach aims to hide the
       recipient's CSI from the DP.  Methods like Private Information
       Retrieval (PIR) or Private Set Membership (PSM) allow the sender
       to perform the lookup without revealing the recipient's
       information to the DP, effectively limiting the DP's knowledge to
       the sender's identity.
